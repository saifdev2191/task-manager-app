Mongoose is a npm module used for better compatiblity between node and mongodb. Apart from doing basing CRUD operation, it provide authentication(
    for ex: document created by user 1 should not be visible to user 2
), validation for document etc

Mongoose basically wraps up the mongodb library with other good functionality. We donot need to use low level mongodb api for our project but can
use mongoose instead.

Mongoose falls under broader category of tools called as ODM(OBJECT DOCUMENT MAPPER). Basically we map our data (object) in node to document in
mongoose database.
                object --> document

Mongoose provide some built-in validation which can be listed when creating model. We can create custom validation in mongoose using function 
validate(value) inside the model
